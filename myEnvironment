I have an ubuntu linux server with docker and portainer.io installed.  
I have a github account for code, and dockerhub for docker images from builds.
My preference for all code is Python, and if local linux scripts, bash.

Code may have notes starting with #AI , do not lose these notes and re-add when regenerating code.  Read the notes for helpful hints.
The idea is to PERSIST the #AI: notes with new generations of code.

The ChatGPT model is connected to the github repo and can read all these files.

CICD Goal:
On my windows 11 development machine I want to implement https://kilocode.ai/ to help with coding using VC code.  I want to deploy a dev container locally to run the code, and instrument for debugging.  When it looks good, then I can kick off build on my linux server.
I want to use LiteLLM to enable routing to different LLMs, and use this when appropriate as part of the coding or rune-time needs.


I have a github account at https://github.com/WebSurfinMurf/.
Here are some repositories and their use:

Repo: https://github.com/WebSurfinMurf/pipeline-runner       
Description: On Ubuntu server, invoking build.sh passing the project name to build into a docker container and deploy.  These scripts are on the linux server

Repo: https://github.com/WebSurfinMurf/secrets
Description: Deployed on my linux server, and NOT stored in the docker container, but the env is made available bsaed on the filename.  For example: MSFGet.env is use by project MSFGet to set its environment variables.
Description: Credentials used for build/deploy on linux server is in pipeline.env, and should be sourced when needed but never include the secrets in code.

Repo: https://github.com/WebSurfinMurf/MSFGet
Description: Project uses playwright to screen scrape information from a web site, store it, convert different pages  to a CSV files, and email those files.

Repo: https://github.com/WebSurfinMurf/AINotes
Description: Contains a variety of files of AI notes, including this file.  

Repo: https://github.com/WebSurfinMurf/AINotes/myEnvironment
Description: Location of this file

Repo: https://github.com/WebSurfinMurf/AINotes/repositories/*
Description: The subdirectory "repositories" may contain filenames matching the name of repositories above, with extension (.md) .  Notes in these folders are scoped to the corresponding project. 

Repo: https://github.com/WebSurfinMurf/AINotes/blob/main/CICD/TargetDev.md
Description: Outline of my CICD goal in detail, with steps.
