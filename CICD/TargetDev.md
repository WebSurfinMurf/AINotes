Given your setup (Windows 11 development machine, Docker containers on Ubuntu, coding in Python using VS Code and Kilo Code), here's a best-practice workflow to code, run, and debug efficiently:

‚úÖ Ideal Setup Overview
Task	Tool/Approach
Development	VS Code on Windows with WSL2 integration
Docker containers	Run inside WSL2 (Ubuntu)
Coding	Use Kilo Code and Python extensions
Debugging	VS Code Remote - WSL & Docker extension

üõ†Ô∏è Step-by-Step Setup
1. Install WSL2 + Ubuntu
From PowerShell (as Admin):

sh
Copy
Edit
wsl --install -d Ubuntu
Restart and set up your Ubuntu user.

2. Install Docker for Windows (WSL2 integration)
Download Docker Desktop

In Docker settings:

Enable WSL2-based engine

Share it with your Ubuntu distro

3. Install VS Code + Extensions
VS Code

Extensions:

Remote - WSL

Python

Docker

(Optional) Dev Containers for full container-based environments

4. Access your code from Ubuntu
Store your project code inside the Linux file system, e.g., /home/yourname/projects, not inside /mnt/c/ for performance.

To open:

sh
Copy
Edit
cd ~/projects/myproject
code .
5. Run and Debug
Use the Remote - WSL environment in VS Code.

Docker commands and containers will run directly inside the Ubuntu WSL.

Python debugging works natively via the Python extension.

Set breakpoints, use launch.json if needed.

6. Use Kilo Code
If you're using the Kilo Code web IDE or agent:

Run it inside WSL or connect it to your Docker container.

It can assist you via its AI capabilities inside VS Code (depending on integration method).

üß† Tips for Peak Productivity
Use devcontainer.json if you want to run the entire environment inside a Docker container with VS Code's "Dev Containers" support.

Run containers with mounted volumes for live code sync:

sh
Copy
Edit
docker run -v ~/projects/myproject:/app -w /app myimage python app.py
For GPU/AI work, ensure Docker Desktop supports your GPU (via WSL2 GPU passthrough if needed).

Would you like a sample Docker Compose + VS Code launch config for your project?
